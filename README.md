# Developing my childhood favorite card game

## Project still in development

## To do

- [x] Generating combos of 4 cards with a full deck of cards (excluding the kings, queens and valets)
- [ ] Limiting the time per turn
- [ ] Logging the time the player took
- [ ] Possibility of infinity mode where one can generate combos indefinitely
- [ ] Styling the game
- [ ] Checking the correctness of a player's answer / being able to define if a combo is impossible to win
- [ ] Calculating a score based on the time + rapidity + correct answers the player found
- [ ] Have a highscore table / multiplayer mode?
